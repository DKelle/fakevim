This script is designed to save time when using vim/emacs/nano to edit a file
This will automatically detect a .FILE.swp file, and ask you if you want to delete it before edditting.
If (y) the swap file is deleted, and the vim command opens the file for you.
If (n) the program exits

If no swap file existed, the vim command executes like normally


Add this to your bashrc to override your vim/emacs/nano commands
alias vim='sh /path/to/remove_swp_file.sh'
